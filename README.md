 Treehouse Techdegree Project 8: Use an API to Create an Employee Directory

 The purpose of this project was to use an API to create an employee directory for a fictional startup company called Awesome Startup. I was instructed to use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. I was instructed to request a JSON object from the API using fetch and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name should open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

 The basic requirements of this project included: using fetch to get and display 12 random users from the Random User Generator API, along with some basic info: image, first and last name, email, and city; creating a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user's card container is clicked, displaying image, name, email, telephone number, detailed address with (street number, street name, city, state, and postcode), and birthdate; structuring and styling the user directory so that it matches provided mockup; adding hover state to the employee cards.

 The extra credit requirements of this project included: adding a way to filter directory by name; adding a way to move back and forth between employees when modal window is open.

 I went beyond the requirements listed above by: hiding and disabling 'back' modal nav button on first employee modal window and hiding and disabling 'forward' modal nav button on last employee modal window; using a mobile-first approach to ensure that the site works on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen widths--including responsive font-sizing to prevent long name/emails from overflowing containers on narrower screen widths and responsize image sizing to allow for largest avatar size while maintaining proper layout.
